# Hall 2014 Replication Study  
In a 2014 study Hall and Stringfield seek to quantiify the degree to which Mexican Populations in the US are residentially segregated from Non-Hispanic White and Non-Hispanic Black Populations. They argue that whether a location is a histrical location of Mexican immigration and the percent that a population is undocumented are strong determininng factors for levels of segregation. Residential segregation was measured using data from the 2000 Census and the 2005-2009 ACS. As a follow up to this study we will be conducting a similar analysis using the same data as well as the 2013-2017 ACS. We suspect that a number of additional factors beyond what Hall and Stringfield propose also effect residential segregation including  
- Labor Market Segregation  
- Demographic composition of mgrants in different locations  
- Different patterns of racialization
