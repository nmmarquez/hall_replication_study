# Data Creation  
Data was pulled from NHGIS and IPUMS USA. See the Hall and Stringfield 2014 for further information on variables used. 

### Creation of Dissimilarity Index Variables  

Variables of interest are gathered from 2000 census as well as 2005-2009 acs and 2012-2017 acs. Required variables from NHGIS include census tract level information.

- ~~Native White population (2000: NPCT063B, 2009: B06004A, 2017: B06004A)~~  
- ~~Native Black population (2000: NPCT063B, 2009: B06004B, 2017: B06004B)~~  
- ~~Mexican Born population (2000: NPCT019D, 2009: B05006, 2017: B05006)~~  

### New Dest Variables  

For these we need data from 1980, 1990, 2000, 2009 5acs, 2017 5acs Mexican Immigrant population and total population information at the metropolitan level. Need to make sure the geographies are sonsitent  


## Percent undocumnted  
Use the IPUMS USA microdata for 2000, 20009 5acs, and 2017 5acs to pull a selection of variables that will be used to classify undocumented immigrants They include.  

- ~~place of birth~~  
- ~~citenzship status~~  
- ~~Year of immigration~~  
- ~~School attendance~~  
- ~~Educational attainment~~  
- ~~class of worker~~  
- ~~Metro location of residence~~

## Characteristics of Mexican Immigrants  

- ~~percent proficient in eglish~~  
- ~~native white household income (for ratio)~~  
- ~~mexican born household income (for ratio)~~  

## Metro characteristics  
- Total population logged  
- Percent Black  
- Percent foreign Born  
- Percent of housing supply built in the last 10 years  
- Percent aged 25 plus that is college educated
